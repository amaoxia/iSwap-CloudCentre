/** a runtime path of execution.
 * 
 * <h3 id="state">State of an execution</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The state of an execution is either active or locked.  An active execution is either 
 * executing or waiting for an external trigger.  If an execution is not in {@link #STATE_ACTIVE_ROOT}
 * or {@link #STATE_ACTIVE_CONCURRENT} then it is locked.  A locked execution is read only.  
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>When a new execution is created, it is in {@link #STATE_ACTIVE_ROOT}.  
 * {@link #STATE_ACTIVE_ROOT Some STATE_* constants} are provided that represent the 
 * most commonly used locked states.  But the state '...' in the picture indicates 
 * that any string can be provided as the state in the lock method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>If an execution is locked, methods that change the execution will throw
 * a {@link JbpmException} and the message will reference the actual locking state.
 * {@link OpenExecution#setVariable(String, Object) updating variables}, 
 * {@link OpenExecution#setPriority(int) updating priority} are not considered to change an 
 * execution.   
 * </p>    
 * 
 * <p>Make sure that comparisons between {@link #getState()} and the 
 * {@link #STATE_ACTIVE_ROOT STATE_* constants} are  
 * done with .equals and not with '==' because if executions are 
 * loaded from persistent storage, a new string is created instead 
 * of the constants.
 * </p>
