/**
 * a activity in a {@link OpenProcessDefinition} graph.
 * 
 * <p>The activity supports both graph based process models as well as 
 * block structured (tree based) process models.  First we describe 
 * tranisions that can be used to formResourceName graph based process structures 
 * and then we'll describe activity composition to formResourceName block structured
 * process models.  Both models can be combined as well.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Activities have {@link #getIncomingTransitions() incoming}
 * and {@link #getOutgoingTransitions() outgoing transitions}.
 * These are lists of transitions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Optionally, transitions can have names.  In that case the 
 * transition {@link #getOutgoingTransition(String) names are associated 
 * to activity's outgoing transitions}.  The {@link #getOutgoingTransitionsMap() map 
 * of outgoing transitions} provides easy access to the named transitions.
 * </p> 
 *   
 * <p>One of the outgoing transitions can optionally be marked as 
 * {@link #getDefaultOutgoingTransition() the default transition}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Block structured process languages have composite activities that can be 
 * modeled with the {@link #getParent() parent}-{@link #getActivities() child} 
 * relation.
