   * It will be delegated to the activity in which the execution is positioned when it 
   * receives the external trigger.

   * 
   * @param execution the {@link Execution} for which the signal is given
   * 
   * @param signalName is an abstract text that can be associated with a signal.  this 
   *   corresponds to e.g. a method name in a java class interface.  The implementation 
   *   can decide e.g. to use the signal to identify the outgoing transition.
   *   
   * @param parameters is extra information that can be provided with a signal.
   *   In this way, it is somewhat similar to the parameters that can be fed into a method 
   *   invocation through reflection.
   *   
   * @throws Exception to indicate any kind of failure.  Note that exceptions are 
   *   considered non recoverable.  After an Exception, the execution should not be
